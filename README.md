# Lennard-Jones Fluid Simulation with Deep Potential

## Dataset generation
- `lj_sim_v1.py` naively generates LJ configurations, including unstable high-energy configurations, and outputs them to `data/`.
- `lj_sim_v2.py` does the same as `lj_sim_v1.py` but filters out high-energy configurations.
- `lj_sim_metal.py` does the same as `lj_sim_v2.py` but generates argon LJ configurations in LAMMPS `metal` units.

## deepmd-kit
- `lj_se_a.json` contains the input file for the datasets generated by `lj_sim_v1.py` and `lj_sim_v2.py`.
- `lj_se_a_metal.json` contains the input file for the dataset generated by `lj_sim_metal.py`.
- `out/` contains various output files.
- `plot_lcurves.py` processes and plots the loss curves generated by deepmd-kit.

## LAMMPS
- `lammps_eval/` contains the LAMMPS input files (one that uses the exact LJ force field, and one that uses the trained Deep Potential force field), a temperature visualization script, and output files from the LAMMPS MD analysis.
